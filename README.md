Business Problem 
 
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each 
hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and 
less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' 
primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to 
offer thorough business advice to address this problem. 
 
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing 
on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.
 
 
 
Assumptions 
 
1. No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on 
the data used. 
2. The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in 
an efficient manner. 
3. There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique. 
4. The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions. 
5. The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking 
cancellations. 
6. Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time. 
7. Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations. 
 
Research Question 
 
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations? 
2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better? 
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions? 
 
Hypothesis 
 
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher. 
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently. 
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their 
reservations.

ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
 
The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled 
and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of 
reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled 
their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings. 
 
Reservation status in different hotels 
 
In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort 
hotels are more expensive than those in cities. 
 
 
The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel 
is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without 
saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates. 
 
 
Reservation status per month 
 
We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and 
lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the 
number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are largest 
in the month of August. whereas January is the month with the most canceled 
reservations. 
 
 
 
 
This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are 
greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the 
accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation. 
 
Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is 
Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.
 
 
 
Let's check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations. 
Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the 
clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of 
clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations. 
 
 
 
 
As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher 
than when it is not canceled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher 
price leads to higher cancellation. 
 
 
SUGGESTIONS
 
 
 
1.Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of 
reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the 
rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some 
discounts to the consumers. 
 
2.As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in 
the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable 
discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays. 
 
3.In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a 
reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in 
this month. 
 
4.They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in 
Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
